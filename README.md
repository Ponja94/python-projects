# python-projects

I developed some projects in python to test the knowledge, I used the PySimpleGUI library to simulate a display and test this knowledge.

Here we have projects:

aventure_game.py - (Not complete) an adventure game that gives answers to the user according to the path he takes

choose_for_me.py - simulates automatic responses for the user

dice_row.py - (not complete) the idea is to make the data that was simulated in these projects show on the screen the side of the data that was randomly chosen

dice_sim.py - simulates a spinning dice giving random value.

guessing_number.py - a game for the user to guess the number.

search_photo.py - user chooses a JPEG photo and can rotate it as well as invert the colors.
